-> The pdf G06_HW1 has our detailed explantions of questions Q1-Q6 and Q7b.
-> hw1.R has the functions to calculate the distances , normalized matrix and also analysis of normalized and the original data matrix.
-> In the analyze_normalization function two plots with names "G06_norm" and "G06_orig" will be saved as pdf files in the local machine.
-> G06_norm is the plot of the plot_distance_matrix function on Normalized matrix.
-> G06_orig is the plot of the plot_distance_matrix function on Original matrix.
-> Two more histograms plots on the normalized matrix and original matrix are shown which appear at run time.
-> The resultant plots are also present in the explanation of 7b.
